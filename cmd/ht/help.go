Several commands accept archive files which combine everything into one
large file. Such an archive file consists of the concatenation of the
different Hjson documents where each document is preceeded by a comment
stating the filename of the document. Any Hjson document can be accessed
with the syntax <filename>@<archive>. Inside the archive the plain filename
is sufficient.

The following example demonstrates using this feature:

    $ cat archive
    # some.suite
    {
        Name: "Some Suite"
        Main: [ {File: sometest.ht}, {File: other.ht} ]

    }

    # other.ht
    {
        Request: { URL: "http://localhost/foo" }
        Checks: [ {Check: "StatusCode", Expect: 505} ]
    }
