// Reading files, querying databases and executing bash scripts
{
    Name: "Pseudo-requests"

    Description: '''
        A normal Test makes a HTTP request but ht also allows to query a
        database, read a file or execute a bash script and perform checks
        on their output. Such 'pseudo-requests' are triggered via special
        schemas in the Request.URL:

          file://  allows to read, write and delete files
          bash://  allows to execute a bash script
          sql://   allows to execute SQL statements against a database

        This example here is a stub, please consult the sub topics.

        // The 'file://' schema makes this a File pseudo-request.
        URL: "file://localhost/etc/passwd"
    }

    Checks: [
        {Check: "Body", Contains: ":root:"}  // to be expected in /etc/passwd
    ]
