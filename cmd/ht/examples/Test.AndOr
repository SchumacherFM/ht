// Logical AND and NOT of Checks
{
    Name: "Logical conjunctions"
    Description: '''
        Sometimes it is natural to express the desired state as the logical OR
        or the logical NOT of several conditions. Two special Checks allow to
        express this: AnyOne and None.
        (The logical AND is the natural composition of the checks in a Test, so
        there is no extra 'AllOf' check.)
    '''
    Request: { URL: "http://{{HOST}}/json" }
    Checks: [
        // The AnyOne-Of check is the logical of the the given sub checks:
	// Only one of the sub-checks in the Of array must succeed:
        // One out of the three content types makes the AnyOne check pass.
        {Check: "AnyOne", Of: [
            {Check: "ContentType", Is: "application/json"}
            {Check: "ContentType", Is: "application/json5"}
            {Check: "ContentType", Is: "application/jsonp"}
	]}

	// The check None expresses the condition that none of the sub
	// checks may succeed. (This example is rather artificial).
	{Check: "None", Of: [
            {Check: "JSON", Element: "Numbers.0", Equals: "2"}
            {Check: "JSON", Element: "Numbers.1", Equals: "40"}
            {Check: "JSON", Element: "Numbers.3", Equals: "17"}
        ]}
    ]

    // Both AnyOne and None are short cicuiting and evaluate only the
    // sub-checks until the overall result is clear.
}
