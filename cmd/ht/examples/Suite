    // Setup and Main are the set of Tests executed and considered relevant
    // for this suite's success. The difference is how Tests with failures or
    // error impact suite execution:
    // If any (executed) test in Setup failes, errors (or is bogus) the suite
    // termiantes and none of the following tests from Setup, none from Main
    // and none from Teardown are executed.
    Setup: [
        { File: "Test" }
    ]

    // Main Tests are executed if all Setup Tests pass. In which case all
    // Tests are executed.
    Main: [
        {File: "Test.JSON"}
        {File: "Test.HTML"}
    ],

    // Teardown Tests are executed after Main (i.e. only if all Setup Tests
    // did pass). Their outcome is reported butdo not influence the Suite
    // status: All teardown tests may fail and the Suite still can pass.
    Teardown: [
       {File: "Test.Image"}
    ]

    // Variables provides a set of variables for the individual Tests.
    // variables defined here in the suite overwrite defaults set in the
    // individual Test files. The values here are overwritten byvalues set
    // on the command line.
    Variables: {
       VARNAME: "varvalue"
    }
}
