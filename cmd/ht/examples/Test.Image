    Name: "Test of a PNG image"
    Description: '''
        The Image check allows to check the file format and the size of an
        image. It also knows about block mean value and color histogram
        fingerprints for images which are nsensitive against some image
        transformations and can be computed via the fingerprint subcommand.
        If you whant to ensure that exacty a certain file is served you
        should use the Identity check.
