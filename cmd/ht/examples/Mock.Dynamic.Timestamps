// Dynamic timestamps, random IDs and counters
{
    Name: "Dynamic timestamps"
    Description: '''
        Sometimes sone needs the current date/time: There is a data Extractor
        for that: SetTimestamp which allows arbitary formating and arbitrary
        offsets.
        If you need a random number use the pre declared variable RANDOM.
        A gloabl counter is available as the pre declared variable COUNTER.
        COUNTER is ever increasing but global; don't assume the next value
        will be the current plus one (it could be plus anything).
