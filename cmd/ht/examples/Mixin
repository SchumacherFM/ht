// Mixins allow to add stuff to a Test
{
    // A Mixin is technically a Test, it has the same fields. But it is
    // not executed directly but mixed into a real Tests to add common
    // stuff like headers or even Checks like this:
    // {
    //     Name: "Some Test"
    //     Mixin: [ "Mixin" ]  // Load this mixin here.
    //     Request: { URL: "http://example.org" }
    // }
    // Mixins are merged into the test through complicated rules.
    // Consult https://godoc.org/github.com/vdobler/ht/ht#Merge for details.
