// Throughput Load-Testing
{
    Name: "A simple Throughput Test"
    Description: '''
        Throughput load tests can be done through the 'load' subcommand.
        The input to 'ht load' is a file describing how different scenarios
        contribute to the overall load generated. The scenarios are based
        on "normal" ht Suites.
        In addition to the standard automatic variables like TEST_DIR or
        RANDOM a load test provides THREAD and REPETITION which number the
        instance of the suite and how often a suite has been repeated.
        See 'go doc github.com/vdobler/ht/suite.Throughput' for details.
