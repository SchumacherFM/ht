// Working with current time or date
{
    Name: "Current time and date"
    Description: '''
        Unfortunately it is not straight forward to include the current date
        or time in a Test. But this can be simulated with Variables:
        You can always inject e.g. the current date via the command line
        as the value of a variable.
        The solution here might be a bit more flexible: The SetTimestamp
        data extractor can "extract" the current date/time (with arbitrary
        offset) into a variable. The value of this variable can be used
        in subsequent tests as the current date/time or some date/time
        in the future or past with defined offset to now.
        The Format string is the reference time Go's time package.

    // A dummy request: We are interested in the current date/time only.
    Request: { URL: "http://{{HOST}}/html" }

    DataExtraction: {
        // Store the current date and time in NOW
        NOW: {Extractor: "SetTimestamp", Format: "2006-01-02 15:04:05" }

	// Store date of the day after tomorrow in FUTURE
        FUTURE: {Extractor: "SetTimestamp", DeltaDay: 2, Format: "2006-01-02" }
    }
}
