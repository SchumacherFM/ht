HTTP Testing Made Easy
======================

End-to-end testing of HTTP request/responses is easy with Go.

Writing and maintaining high level test is even easier with ht.


## Goals

ht tries to achieve the following:
* Make generating all common HTTP requests easy.
* Provide high- and low-level checks on the received response. 
* Make measuring response times easy.
* Make it easy to generate a certain load.
